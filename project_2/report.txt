A) Some problems I had to overcome while completing this project: I had problems calculating the tax amount within each tax bracket, where I would be attempting to find the tax on a bigger sum of money within a certain bracket than was needed. This was due to a complex series of calculations that I used within the CalculateRevenue method in the LicenseToBill class, which I later simplified by breaking out the tax bracket calculation into a separate method and used a structure to represent the constants for each tax bracket used.
In addition, I also had problems with the CLI frontend where input given to the program would be interpreted as both a revenue input and a country name. After reading the project FAQ page, I realized that I needed ot add in a ::std::cin.ignore(...) statement to avoid skipping input.

B) Tests:
No identification input before return (
, 10, USA)
Negative revenue (Mayfair House New York, -1, USA)
No country input before return (Mayfair House New York, -1,
)
Zero revenue (Mayfair House New York, 0, USA)
Lowercase UAE revenue (House, 10, uae)
Special country revenue #1 (House, 100, UAE)
Special country revenue #2, equal to special country revenue #1 (House, 100, Turkey)
General country revenue, less than special country revenue (House, 100, USA)
First tier revenue calculation (House, 10, USA)
Second tier revenue calculation (House, 30, USA)
Third tier revenue calculation (House, 60, USA)
